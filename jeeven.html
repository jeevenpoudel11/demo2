        <p class="jiwan">Jhené Aiko Efuru Chilombo (/dʒəˈneɪ ˈaɪkoʊ/;[3] born March 16, 1988) is an American singer and
    songwriter who
    embarked on her music career contributing vocals and appearing in several music videos for R&B group B2K. In an
    effort to promote Aiko and cultivate a following for her, she was marketed as B2K member Lil' Fizz's
    cousin;[4][5] she is not actually related to him.[6][7] In 2003, Aiko was set to release her debut album, My
    Name Is Jhené, through her labels Sony, The Ultimate Group and Epic; however, the album was never released, and
    Aiko asked to be released from the label in order to continue her education.[8]</p>

            In March 2011, Aiko made her return to music with the release of her first full-length project, a mixtape
            titled Sailing Soul(s). On December 16, 2011, Aiko signed a recording contract with American record producer
            No I.D.'s record label ARTium, under the aegis of Def Jam Recordings.[9] In 2013, Aiko appeared on Big
            Sean's single "Beware" alongside Lil Wayne, which became her first top 40 single on the US Billboard Hot 100
            chart. In November 2013, she released her first project for Artium and Def Jam, an extended play (EP),
            titled Sail Out. The EP was supported by the singles "3:16AM", "Bed Peace" (featuring Childish Gambino) and
            "The Worst", the latter of which went on to become certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association
            of America (RIAA).

            Aiko released her major-label debut album, Souled Out, on September 9, 2014.[10] On September 22, 2017, she
            released her second studio album Trip.[11] On March 6, 2020, she released her third studio album, Chilombo,
            which earned Aiko three Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year.
